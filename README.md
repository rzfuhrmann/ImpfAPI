# ImpfAPI

quick-n-dirty script to provide vaccine data asap on a daily basis \
Request latest data (automatically refreshed at least once per day):
* Everything as JSON list: https://impfapi.rz-fuhrmann.de/v0/all_list.json 
* Everything as JSON objects: https://impfapi.rz-fuhrmann.de/v0/all_object.json
* Everything as InfluxDB (different metric names!): https://impfapi.rz-fuhrmann.de/v0/all_influx.7z

We'll add live data refresh and more parameters soon - in v1. ;)
